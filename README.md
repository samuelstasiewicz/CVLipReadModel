UNCW Computer-Vision (452) Final Project: Lip Reading CNN

main.py contains a script to capture our lip data
- Install necessary libraries
- run main.py
- press space to record a data point
    - to record a new word, change the <word ="hello"> line to the word you are recording
    - start saying your word as soon as space bar is pressed with little delay in order to fully capture the
      word in 30 frames
- I will be continuing to update the code and github
